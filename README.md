#  Spatiotemporal pattern of measles vaccination in U.S. states

Declining Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake among U.S. young children has sparked fears of measles becoming endemic again. We assess this threat by introducing a novel statistic that quantifies cumulative measles susceptibility dynamics. Leveraging county-specific annual data from multiple states, our analysis reveals alarming trends. Increasing susceptibility  children and teens, and state-specific regional patterns of heightened outbreak risk influenced by unique social and geographic factors. 

## Significance
This approach transcends traditional case reporting, providing a comprehensive view of measles vulnerability across age groups and regions. Our findings have implications for public health strategy, offering critical insights for targeted interventions and policy formulation to avert a potential measles resurgence. This study marks a significant advance in our understanding of vaccine-preventable disease dynamics and sets a new standard for assessing population-level susceptibility to infectious diseases.

## Data sources
The publicly available immunization data records by school strict and county was obtained from Department of Health in State of California [1], Minnesota [2], Conneticate [3], Washington [4], and Texas [5]. Kindergarden enrollment records by school strict and county in Texas were obtained from the Texas Departments of Education [6] while this information was listed in the immunization records for other states.
